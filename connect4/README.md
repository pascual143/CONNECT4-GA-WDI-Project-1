#Process

   Start with the simple HTML basics to developt the javascript logic, including titles, rules and buttons on top of the grid.

   Thought planning pseudocode we make the grid with div's in html and we associate them with javascript.

   At the beginning we create the start button(begin). After press it, javascript will moves thought the for loop to go to the play1 and coin to draw the movement in the grid that it would be draw by the function before. we make the function to win and the combinations to wins in the function checkForWin who will alert who wins if all condition happen.
